### 3. "Knowledge source says 'Failed to process'"

**Symptoms:**
- Red error message when adding knowledge source
- "Processing failed" status
- Knowledge source won't load

**Solutions:**
‚úÖ **Check website accessibility**: Ensure the website is publicly accessible (not behind login)

### 4. "My agent is too slow to respond"

**Symptoms:**
- Long delays before responses

**Solutions:**
‚úÖ **First queries are slower**: Initial responses take longer as the system learns
‚úÖ **Reduce knowledge sources**: Too many sources can slow processing
‚úÖ **Simplify instructions**: Shorter, clearer instructions process faster
‚úÖ **Check internet connection**: Slow connections affect response time
‚úÖ **Peak usage times**: Try testing during off-peak hours
